# Repository Maintenance Strategy

This repository follows the maintenance strategy agreed by GOV.UK One Login Tech Leads and Tech Leadership in Spring 2023.
Details can be found in this document:

[Maintenance strategy for common tech components - GOV.UK One Login](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16PBsdPC6q6KayMG0beiLgeqZUuFn8OeiQwURhFJEPPg/edit#heading=h.swngs1tj830v)

## Duties of a maintainer

## Understand their tool

- Establish a scope with Tech leads for basic maintenance
- Keep that scope under periodic review
- Attend any incident reviews involving the tool

## Keep things running

- Undertake that maintenance (dependency updates, security updates etc)
- Collate improvements and unmet program needs the tool could help with
- Ensure documentation for the tool is up-to-date, and it is easy to support for 2ndline or on-call

## Manage their time

- Request support from Tech Leads if the amount of time to work on a tool exceeds what their team can support.

## Make appropriate improvements

- Anticipate and provide early warning for major changes that would impact the tool and would require more sustained work (changes in hosting, modernisation of deprecated infrastructure, alignment with new standards, major changes to dependencies), and agree time and scope to work on those with Tech Leads and Teams

## Ensure continuity of maintenance

- Ensure maintenance of the tool is handed over as part of any long term absence or change of duties, or that responsibility reverts to the relevant community that owns the tool

Additionally the maintainer or Tech Leads should ensure that the tool remains fit for purpose in meeting its established needs. Where that ceases to be true, or where the resources to maintain are no longer proportionate to the value, the tool should be removed to mitigate risk to the program of unowned resources.
